    "Examine variable importance of drivers to loyalty for segments/cohorts (instead of ALL DATA, as was used in the UX Index calculation). Ultimately, this taps into segment/cohort driven differences in UXIndex and UX_Loyalty. UX_Loyalty is an individual metric, calculated directly from individual answeres to questions. UXIndex was calculated based on weighting of drivers with the weights determined based on variable importance to UX_Loyalty at an aggregate level ( for ALL DATA) (refered to as **universal weights**). As such, we imagine tht for some cohorts/segements where the aggregate mapping does not match, UX_index would be a worse approximationthan for cohorts segemnts where the aggregate mapping does match."
